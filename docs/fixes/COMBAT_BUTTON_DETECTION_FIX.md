# 🔧 Combat Button Detection Fix - RESOLVED

## 🚨 Problem Identified

The bot was failing during combat because it was giving up too quickly when the attack button became temporarily unavailable due to cooldown, even when the enemy still had HP remaining.

### Error Pattern:
```
🎯 Enemy HP: 9.0%
⚔️ Attack button no longer available
⚠️ No attack button but enemy still alive
🚪 Looking for leave button immediately...
⚠️ Leave button not found after 2.0s (20 attempts)
```

## ✅ Root Cause Analysis

1. **Attack Button Cooldown**: After each attack, the button becomes temporarily disabled
2. **Premature Exit**: Bot was checking button availability too quickly after HP check
3. **Insufficient Wait Time**: Only waited 1.5s for button to become available again
4. **Missing HP Monitoring**: Didn't check if enemy died during button wait period

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. Extended Button Wait Time
- **BEFORE**: 1.5 seconds maximum wait
- **AFTER**: 2.0 seconds maximum wait
- **IMPACT**: More time for button cooldown to complete

### 2. Continuous HP Monitoring During Wait
```python
# NEW: Check HP during button wait period
for wait_attempt in range(20):  # 2.0s total wait
    if await self._is_attack_button_available(page):
        attack_button_available = True
        break

    # ADDED: Check if enemy died during wait
    current_hp = await self._get_enemy_hp_percentage(page)
    if current_hp <= 0:
        logger.success("💀 Enemy defeated during button wait!")
        break

    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
```

### 3. Enhanced Combat End Detection
- **Extended Leave Button Wait**: 3.0 seconds (was 2.0s)
- **Double HP Verification**: Checks HP multiple times during Leave button search
- **Better Low-HP Handling**: Special handling for enemies with <5% HP

### 4. Improved Error Recovery
- More robust detection of combat completion
- Better handling of edge cases (button disabled but enemy alive)
- Prevents false combat exits

## 📊 Technical Changes

### Modified Logic Flow:
```
OLD FLOW:
attack → check HP → check button availability immediately → exit if no button

NEW IMPROVED FLOW:
attack → check HP → wait up to 2.0s for button AND monitor HP →
if no button: verify combat end with Leave button search →
double-check HP before final exit
```

### Key Improvements:
- **20 attempts** instead of 15 for button detection
- **Continuous HP monitoring** during waits
- **Extended timeouts** for more reliable detection
- **Multi-stage verification** before combat exit

## 🧪 Expected Results

The combat system should now:
1. ✅ **Wait longer** for attack buttons to become available
2. ✅ **Monitor HP continuously** during button waits
3. ✅ **Detect enemy defeat** even during button cooldowns
4. ✅ **Complete combat reliably** without premature exits
5. ✅ **Handle edge cases** better (low HP, slow UI updates)

## 🎯 Test Scenario Resolution

For the reported case:
- Enemy at 9% HP with button unavailable
- **OLD**: Immediately exit combat (FAILURE)
- **NEW**: Wait 2.0s monitoring HP, verify with Leave button, complete properly (SUCCESS)

## 📝 Status

✅ **FIXED** - Combat button detection now waits appropriately and monitors HP continuously during button availability checks.

The bot should no longer prematurely exit combat when the enemy still has HP remaining but the attack button is temporarily disabled due to cooldown.
